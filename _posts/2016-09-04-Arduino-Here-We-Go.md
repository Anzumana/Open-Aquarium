So far we did some led blinking since that always fun :). And some thermometer test.  
Sadly our thermometer we used [TMP36 - Temperature Sensor](http://www.amazon.com/SparkFun-TMP36-Temperature-Sensor/dp/B007R9UM78)  
gave us temperatures that seemed to be to high.  
I mean i like it to be warm but 384 Celsius would be a bit to hot even for me. :)  
Here is q quick video were we used johnny five to let an led blink.
